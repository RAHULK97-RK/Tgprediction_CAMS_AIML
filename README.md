AI/ML BASED THREE MODELS FOR TG PREDICTIONS IN COAMORPHOUS SYSTEMS
# Tg Prediction for Co-Amorphous Drug Systems

This repository contains code, figures, and documentation related to the prediction of glass transition temperature (Tg) for co-amorphous systems using machine learning models. The models were developed using Random Forest, XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), trained on a curated dataset of 303 coamorphous drug–drug and drug–coformer combinations.

## Contents
- `notebook/`: Jupyter notebooks for model development, training, and SHAP analysis.
- `data/`: Input descriptor matrix (public portion) and supporting example data.
- `results/`: Generated figures (e.g., parity plots, SHAP plots) and model performance tables.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the main Jupyter notebook in the `notebook/` directory. Ensure all dependencies are installed using:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data Availability
Due to data sharing restrictions, the full experimental dataset (303 entries) used for model training is not shared publicly in this repository. Interested researchers may request access by contacting the corresponding author.
